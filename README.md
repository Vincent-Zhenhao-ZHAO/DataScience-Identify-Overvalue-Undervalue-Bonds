# Identifying Overvalued and Undervalued Bonds for Daily Capture through Data-Driven Analysis.

## Project Description
This project involves in-depth analysis and visualization of bond market data, focusing on attributes such as coupon rates, bid-ask spreads, index prices, and more. The analysis aims to reveal key insights into the distribution and interrelationships of bond market characteristics.

## Project Overview
Mispricing of fixed-income assets, particularly bonds, can challenge investors seeking to determine accurate valuations. This study proposed two models for identifying potentially overvalued and undervalued bonds by employing the metrics of yield to maturity (YTM) and option-adjusted spread (OAS). The study used duration and DV01 (dollar value of an 01) to corroborate these findings. The research also explored how non-financial institutions can influence bond mispricing, especially in the oil and gas sector. While limited historical data prevented in-depth precision evaluation of the result, this study still provided a valuable framework for further exploration.
